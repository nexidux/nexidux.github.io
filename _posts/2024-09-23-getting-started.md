## Fundamentals

This blog is going to assume a few things

We aren't all starting from step one for the most part and if you are this blog might still be of some help for you but 
more than likely you should get a few more tools in the belt before moving forward from here.

For starters I am going to assume you know most of the stuff from a basic entry level certification like the CompTIA A+ exam and
that's not to say that you have the certification itself but if I mention RAM or mention cables like ethernet you aren't immediately lost.

Getting up to this point shouldn't take too long or much work I would recommend looking into Professor Messer on youtube as he helped a ton
of us getting into the field and starting out with a lot of the fundamental certification courses. Once you feel you have an okay level of 
understanding when it comes to IT then we can get into more networking focused subjects. Moving forward from here we are going to be 
references Jeremy's IT Lab and the CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide books volume 1 & 2.

By no means do I expect you to go out and purchase these books and really hope you proceed with whatever works best for you as I know
what I like to use for learning and I am sure you have preferences as well, but if you don't know where to start you can begin with the
Jeremy's IT Lab on youtube, pay around $20 for Jeremy's Udemy course, or spring for the CCNA books I just mentioned. All of these resources
have helped me tremendously and would recommend atleast giving them a try if you would like a starting point.

That about wraps up this first post on what you might need going forward and following along.

While I may not cover everthing chapter by chapter you can rely on my posts covering everything that might be relevent or interesting.

Best of luck with your studies,
